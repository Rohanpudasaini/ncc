In programming, an error refers to an unexpected or incorrect behavior that occurs when executing a program. Errors can be categorized into three main types: syntax errors, runtime errors, and logical errors.

1. **Syntax Errors**: These occur when the code violates the rules of the programming language. They prevent the program from being compiled or interpreted. Common examples include misspelled keywords, missing semicolons, or incorrect variable names.

2. **Runtime Errors**: These errors occur during the execution of a program and can cause it to terminate abruptly. Common examples include division by zero, accessing an out-of-bounds array index, or trying to open a file that doesn't exist.

3. **Logical Errors**: Also known as "bugs," these errors don't cause the program to crash but lead to incorrect or unexpected results. They occur when the program's logic doesn't match the intended behavior. Logical errors are usually the hardest to identify and fix.

In C#, you can handle errors using try-catch blocks to gracefully manage exceptions that occur during runtime. Here's an example that demonstrates error handling in C#:
